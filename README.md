# TryHackMe: Intro to SIEM

## Objective
The Introduction to Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) project aims to develop a foundational understanding of SIEM systems, including their purpose, functionality, and importance in cybersecurity. The project emphasizes network visibility, log sources, and log ingestion processes, while exploring the analytical capabilities provided by SIEM platforms. Hands-on lab work reinforces these concepts by simulating real-world scenarios where alerts are generated and analyzed to determine if they are true or false positives.

### Skills Learned
- Strong understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to investigate alerts and determine if they're True or False positives.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- TryHackMe's sample SIEM dashboard and events for log ingestion and analysis.
- Windows Event Viewer for viewing events in a Windows environment.


### Steps
- The importance of SIEM and why it is critical to have better visibility of all the activities within a network.
- Log Sources: common devices that are found in a network environment, such as Windows machines and Linux Workstations.
- Log ingestion, which is the process of collecting log data from various sources, such as applications, servers, and network devices, and sending it to a central location for storage, analysis, and monitoring.
- Lab Work: A sample SIEM dashboard and events are displayed. A suspicious activity ocurrs and an alert is triggered. You then look through the event log to find the event that triggered the alert. Once you find the event, you are shown the rule that triggered the alert. Finally you determine whether the alert is a True-positive and isolate the host or a False-positive and tune the rule.
